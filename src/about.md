I really, really like making websites. I love designing them, writing code for them and I find meaning in helping people to more authentically express themselves on this amazing medium.

Before discovering what it feels like to turn design into code, I spent a lot of my time wanting to just create. I wanted to be an illustrator, an artist and then a photographer, until I realized that I really wanted to be a web designer. Though maybe that is also a bit too reductive, I didn’t want to be a web designer, I just wanted to turn design into code.

At some point while accidentaly discovering and playing around with HTML and CSS, something clicked. And then I was just hooked on this feeling of being able to turn what I carefully crafted to be nice to look at intso something that also feels nice to interact with. And that’s what I’ve been primarily doing since then.
For a short while I was also teaching people at SAE Vienna the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Today

Nowadays what I’m aligned with the most is Design Engineering, Designops, #a11y, small tech and the indie web.
