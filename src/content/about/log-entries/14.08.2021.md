+ Redesigned the overall layout. This was really important, because the way that the compound grid was layed out initially meant a overall decrease in available space for the main content. This meant a lot of nested `orientation: landscape;` mediaqueries and a lot of repetitive code. I decided to pull the plug and switched to a more centered layout on desktop. With this, I did some visual tweaks everywhere to tied it all together.
