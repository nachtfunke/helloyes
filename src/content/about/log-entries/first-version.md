title: "First Version Priorities"
---

Here is a bit of a summary of the things that were important to me for the initial, first version of the site:

+ All markdown-rendered headlines have anchor links. They are being generated by the markdown-it-anchor plugin - enhanced with [code from Nicolas Hoizey](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2021/02/25/accessible-anchor-links-with-markdown-it-and-eleventy/), based on suggestions [researched by Amber Wilson](https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/are-your-anchor-links-accessible/).
+ I wanted to _reduce_ **JavaScript** as much as possible use it only to progresively enhance. So the `:target`-selector in combination with url-fragments is being utilized to show the mobile flyout-menu and the color-settings on larger screens. I have not made this before - if you discover an issue, please let me know!
+ Providing a skip-to-content link. While researching on what [knowledgable people](https://kittygiraudel.com/2020/12/06/a11y-advent-skip-to-content/) that I look up to have to say about this topic, I also remembered reading that one of the WCAG suggested techniques for the corresponding success criteria ([2.4.1, Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html)) suggested adding links to multiple parts of the website. I never had the opportunity to implement that, so now was the time. I'm curious to find out if there is any response to this.
+ Get it out as _quickly_ as possible. I new that I didn't want to wait until I had all the content and design for everything done. I just wanted to be a little bit ahead with it, so that I could pick up development work whenever. But I also needed it to find a new job, so I decided that it needs to go live with the two pages most important for that (Hiring & About) and the imprint.
