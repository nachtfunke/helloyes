+ add interrupting sections of content to some timeline events, `.intermezzo`, as nunjucks macros
+ add work-domain patterns to represent ux, design, frontend, backend & brand to be used in presentational "work-diagrams" (first as images, then as svg). They're accent-color-override sensitive!
+ remove the arrow-icons from the main-navigation and place the main-navigation more accurately on the main grid
+ add a fix for the `.ico` favicon file; Sometimes, the mime-type isn't correct
+ Replace the websites main `<h1>` with "hello, yes." Instead of "Thomas M. Semmler". Need to test how this affects/works
+ add some missing `:hover` styles.
