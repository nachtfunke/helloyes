This post is probably too long, but I need some place that I can refer to. As is often the case, I am writing this to sort my thoughts, primarily. But I am hoping to give voice to what I am observing in other people in our field, but is rarely being spoken about. I am not attempting to postulate a solution to a complex problem, instead am trying to provide words, in hopes that it resonates with what other people are experiencing, if nothing else just to let them know, that they are not alone with it.

Every good post starts with a quote, right?

> [Industry means] something that is produced or is available in large quantities and makes a lot of money.

We have long referred to our niche of the web as the "web industry" but never has the term been more congruent than it is right now. I believe this throws us into some conflicts, that we are left deal with alone. Because what we've been learned in the decades before, what mattered to the craft of making websites, seems to sometimes not be compatible with what is asked of us from our jobs. This throws us into significant conflict, and resolution seems to be left on our own. In this post I am trying to tackle this conflict that has been on my mind for so long.

## Welcome to the Age of Industrialisation

I think it is very clear for most of us to see, that our little corner of the world has reached the age of industrialisation. With this "little corner", I am referring to the community of people who make websites. Designers, Developers and everything in between and beyond alike.

There are many signs that we have irreversibly entered a new era, one that is determined by industrial practices. We constantly hear, that we're not supposed to _reinvent wheels_, websites are now being derogatorily called MPA's (Multi Page Apps), and we're generally referring to websites as software. UI is now coming in the form of self-contained, composable pieces of single sources of truth's, "components", and the question "will it scale?" is the number one differentiator for "maturity" in tooling surrounding our craft.

### Scalability as Leitdifferenz

A single difference that allows us to sort something into a dichotomy - that is what a "Leitdifferenz" refers to (I am using the German word directly here, to refer to [Niklas Luhmann's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) concept, because I cannot find a semantically fitting translation). We have been obsessed with this scalability as the single, differentiating factor, that will tell us how well something will adapt with the changing requirements of an organisation and increasing, diverse technical demand. But for businesses, scaling means that output remains or only slightly degrades, while production costs lower.

Scalability has become the _leading difference_, the Leitdifferenz, of almost everything in our industry. From the tech we develop with, for and on, to what, how and who we design for. It has become almost a trance, that we keep repeating even to each other. "But will it scale?" is first and foremost a matter of business. But in development and design, it also refers to other factors. Yet when it comes to matters of industrialisation, these factors remain to be secondary.

For example, a course is a scaling product. Because you are investing time into its production and then all you have to do is maybe every now and then generate a promotional advertisement for it, but the price remains the same, while your initial expense disappears entirely. Your margin has increased - your product value has _scaled_. The purpose of industry in general is to achieve scaling by reducing production cost. Create a "streamlined" (another term that we have gotten very familiar with) manufacturing process, automate it as much as possible, to generate a product that will sell to as many consumers as possible.

### Configured, Consumed & Composed: Components and Design Systems

We can consider design systems themselves even as an [answer to the question of scalability for design](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/scale-design-systems/). And even here, scaling is still the Leitdifferenz by which we categorize. Design work is being compartmentalised into "components", small, self-contained deliverables that can then be composed together by someone who is not a designer. The idea is that this will allow for a more efficient and scalable design process. But obviously, design is more than just that. And design is still happening by the person who composes components together - just without the skills necessary. So the reaction is to create an even more restrictive set of rules, so that instead of applying systemic priniples to design work in order to _enable_ design work, it is being reduced to a set of consumable components and rules.

That is not the premise of design systems as a way of working, but it is what some designers are postulating, because it is what sells them to industry. The way that industry incorporates design systems is basically a misappropriation, or abuse at worst. It is not just me who is seeing the problem with ongoing industrialisation in design. Even Brad Frost, the inventor of atomic design, is observing [similar things](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-agile-and-industrialization/). In the words of [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/16369):

> [...] design systems take their place in a long history of dehumanising approaches to manufacturing like Taylorism. The priorities of “scientific management” are the same as those of design systems—increasing efficiency and enforcing consistency.

So no. It is not just you. We all feel it. This quote is from 2020, by the way. What was then a prediction, has since become reality. And it is also reflected in the way that people are entering the industry. Lately, we've seen a lot of [bootcamps](https://medium.com/swlh/the-good-bad-and-the-ugly-of-web-dev-coding-bootcamps-e82d2715eabf) popping up, that for the most part educate people _just_ enough so that they can [get a job](https://cult.honeypot.io/reads/the-ugly-truth-about-coding-bootcamps/). But they rarely know the principles, values and philosophies that constitue the web platform. But they can create a full functioning "web app" with next.js in react! Of course they don't learn how to manage CSS for this type of site, instead they just use tailwind. But at least they know how to specify TypeScript interfaces!

And of course, they learn that design comes from UI Libraries. Gone are the days where we used to tell people that bootstrap is just for prototyping and otherwise will quickly turn into technical dept! Nowadays, designers are sometimes even being told to _start_ with one of these libraries. Just, they're not called bootstrap. Instead, they're called Material UI, Headless UI or Chakra UI. But they bare every necessary resemblance. But it's fine, because it's just the components, right?

What could have become Design Systemics, in which we applied systems theory/theories, cybernetics and constructivism to the process and practice of design, is now instead being reduced to component libraries. As a designer, I find this utter nonsense. Everyone who has even just witnessed a design process happening, knows that the deliverable is merely a documenting artefact of the process, but does not constitute it at all. But for companies, the "output" is all that matters, because it can be measured - it appeals to the industrialised process, because it _scales_. Once a component is designed, it can be reused, configured and composed to produce "free" iterations, without having to consult a designer. Cost was reduced, while the output was maximised. Goal achieved!

## Seats at the Capitalists Table

The larger premise of design has degraded over the years, in my opinion. As it got more embraced into the industrial process, it did so by devaluating the perspective of people who the discipline used to design _for_ and replaced it with the perspective of companies. This is the price that design continues to pay for its seat at the capitalists table. A cost, in my opinion, too large to be worth it. This was also one of the reasons for why [I decided to not pursue it as a career any longer, in 2022](/blog/2022/leaving-design#what-it-is).

When we referred to ourselves as Web Designers, we were constantly struggling to find companies that took our profession serious enough to integrate us into their processes. But design was not considered valuable. So we started to call ourselves UX Designers, because we were designing experiences, not websites. And slowly but surely, we got our oh so desired seat at the table. But only, if we provided proof of our value, by demonstrating a number-go-up linear-causal relation to our work, requiring, of course, extensive surveillance of our users. And thus, companies have successfully forced us to degrade the merit of our work to quantifiable markers of increased conversions, clicks and the firing of whatever other random KPI that we could somehow pull off our asses - all to appeal to the growth-at-any-cost mindset.

This often happens with important values of our craft. The recent increase of attention on accessibility is already taken a similar path. Accessibility advocates & experts are often forced to "sell" (see what I did there?) accessibility work to companies, by showing them how much more revenue, conversions or users they could be having, by making their sites accessible. But our craft on the other hand clearly dictates this as a primary focus - a Leitdifferenz to judge the merit of our work. If what we do isn't accessible, it's to a certain degree broken, or incomplete at best.

The problem with this angle is that inevitably, industry will answer industriously. And now we're having to explain to companies why they cannot just install an overlay and see it done. But that is the price of putting a number on marginalised groups. Unfortunately that is the language that businesses speak, so experts & advocates are not to blame. They are doing the best that they can, because they know that in the end, the removal of barriers for people who rely on it is what matters. They are in their own way, navigating ambivalence and finding their way through the conflict of craft vs industry.

### When Places become Products

UX Design used to stand for "User Experience", but in order to get our seat at the table, we had to degrade it so much, that it has long since shifted its meaning to "User Exploitation", as [Mark Hurst writes](https://creativegood.com/blog/21/losing-faith-in-ux.html). The practice of UX, removed so far from its subject, that it now considers the company itself the subject of their work, now is being used for bad-faith manipulation to increase capitalist numbers.

This reflected in another marker in language. Were we once web designers, and then UX designers, so are we now calling ourselves "Product Designers". As designers, our relationship to what we design and who we design it for has changed. We used to design websites for people, then experiences for users, now we are designing products for companies.

This coincides with the fact that we are now broadly regarding websites as software - but we're not calling them websites. We're calling them "Apps". And it makes sense - we have entirely normalised the practice of having our websites being controlled by JavaScript from Server to Client, because JavaScript is _mature_ now and thus appealing to traditional programmers, who used to shun it vividly.

This change in demographic of who write code has made it easier to hire for these positions. A website that is entirely rendered in JavaScript can be worked on by someone with a University Degree, in which they rarely learn the special relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript but instead are being told that CSS and HTML are not real programming languages. And with these capital P Programmers their language comes long and so does their world view and their heuristics.

## The Craftsperson vs The Factory Worker

People making websites who are also working in what we refer to as "the web industry", often are forced to into a difficult conflict. In their position as an employee or freelancer, they sometimes have to work on technology they know isn't compatible with the values that they learned to hold dear in their craft. Designers are asked to implement [dark patterns](https://www.deceptive.design/), even though they know that it is unethical. Developers are asked to work with React, even though they are aware that it is maintained by facbook, a company [profiting and and enabling genocide](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/). And the list goes on.

It is also expressed in what I think is best summarized as "Indusry Fomo". Developers know fully well, that using next.js to create a relatively simple website is overkill, inappropriate at best, but they see themselves required to use industry-grade technology, because job requirements are not listing skills anymore, instead they are listing tools and frameworks.

I consider this a conflict between two identities: The Craftsperson and The Factory Worker. The craftsperson wants to do what honors the values of the craft, but the factory worker needs to do what will keep them employed or employable. A conflict that we are being left alone with, often lacking the words to conceptualise what is really happening here.

### Separating Concerns

Postulating to know a solution to what I consider would be hubris on so many parts. But what I can do, is access a little trick from my work as a [systemic counsellor](https://sonstnichts.com/). Systemic counsellig operates on many different principles, one of them being [second order cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cybernetics), in which cybernetic principles are applied to cyberntics itself - recursive cybernetics. We know a thing or two about recursions, right? We can apply some of the principles that we usually use a guiding light in our craft to our own situation: [Separation of Concerns](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#separation-of-concerns).

While this integer design principle of HTML is usually referred to in order to justify separation the concerns of content (markup, HTML), presentation (styles, CSS) and behaviour (scripting, JavaScript), it is also a [general design principle in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) and we can also use it to separate the concerns of the craftsperson and the factory worker.

If we separate the demand into independent concerns, made by independent parties, we get the chance to instead of having to decide, to _hold_ the ambivalence and the _complexity_ of the situation. Industry of course would force us to reduce complexity, another religious mantra of Programming. But complexity means possibility, and with possibility comes the ability to _decide_. Do we go with what the industry demands, or do we go with what the craft demands? The conflict is the oscillation between both possible decisions. Not only can we not decide, but we also are uneasy with the fact that we cannot decide. Fritz B. Simon calls this a "Double Negation", and it becomes the constituitional marker of conflict, described systemically.

But what if instead of oscillating between both positions, trying to make a decision, we instead remain in this ambivalence for a little while? A room emerges, that we are holding. In this room, both positions aren't changed, but it may allows us to not experience them in conflict with each other. If we understand them as a conflict of concerns and not a conflict of identity, we may even see where both concerns even align. Or we can give voices to both parts.

At the very least, it may help us to not experience this as a personal conflict, but instead leave it to the job, which has to find a way to utilise craft in a way that makes it compatible enough with industrial processes - another different concern reveals itself here, the concern of the business, not the concern of the employee.

## Failing to conciliate competing Identities

This isn't always possible though. And sometimes, people may decide by leaving the industry, but also the craft all together - to protect themselves from this conflict. Not because they couldn't hold the ambivalence of the craftsperson and the factory worker as is, but because they don't want to degrade themselves or their view of the craft - or maybe, because they weren't able to see two separate concerns, but instead saw a personal conflict that they were left to deal with on their own.

But if we somehow manage to conciliate those two competing identities, we may find some personal relief from trying to find a common ground between two competing sides within ourselves. I have to work with technology that I find deeply offensive and politically abhorrent all day. But at some point, I found great relief in understanding myself as an employer who works with this tech, not as a craftsperson working not he web. I understand that it is not people who want to create SPA's, it's industry - its businesses.

Many people are not differentiating here, and so they just repeat the capitalist programmers mantras. But that says much more about how they relate to and how they define themselves. Do they even consider themselves as craftspeople? Do they even _see_ the craft that is there?

Ultimately, the fact that we see a conflict here can be considered a good sign. As I said before, systemically, we can understand a conflict as an oscillation between possibilities. That means, that in order to experience a conflict, we firstly need to see possibilities. So if you are currently battling this conflict, you may find some relief by knowing that you are experiencing it, because you see possibilitites and you are not submerged into the trance of the factory worker, induced by industry.

## AI: The Penultimate of Dehumanisation

We do need to talk about AI, because it is an inevitable part of industrialisation and there is no escape for any of us. The desire to reduce manual labour by automation and reduction of complexity is the seed that gave birth to programming in the first place, and AI is a tangible premise of endless scaling. I think it would be incredibly unwise and hubris to assume that the broad majority of us who is employed at this time will remained to be employed in the next years.

Apologists often claim that "we will move on to other things", but that is not true. Some of us will divorce further from craft and appeal to business desires in managing or other administrative jobs but these jobs are given, not earned. The value of our work will inevitably reduce massively, and few of us will be able to do what we do now and get paid for it.

The groundwork for this is laid out already. Take a look at dribbble and you'll find one interchangeable site after another. And this is the dataset that AI is being trained on, because it can't look at actual website, it only looks at pixels for the most part. But even if it were looking at real websites - they have long since started to look so similar, that they are often only differentiated by theming.

In order to protect ourselves from this inevitable reality (again, programming was invented to make human labour in weaving redundant; This is the Leitdifferenz of the entire profession.), we can learn to understand employability does not make us craftspeople.

## The Craft remains

Because the craft will remain even after most of it is automated. You can order mugs online, yet there are still potters out there. We can go into C&A and buy a dress, but there are still seamstresses making bespoke garments. This is the inevitable end destination of the craft - where it started.

Handcrafted websites, made by humans for humans. This is what differentiates our Craftsperson from the Factoryworker - what the Craftsperson does is valuable to people, not businesses.

And until that time comes, we can be both at the same time. We can hold both perspectives as important voices with different concerns. We can switch between them, look for the common ground, or side with one or the other in a given situation.

So the next time you are approaching a website, ask yourself: "What would the Craftsperson do?" And also ask yourself: "What would the Factoryworker do?" - see what answers you come up with!
