This post is probably too long, but I need some place that I can refer to. As is often the case, I am writing this to sort my thoughts, primarily. But I am hoping to give voice to what I am observing in other people in our field, but is rarely being spoken about. I am not attempting to postulate a solution to a complex problem, instead am trying to provide words, in hopes that it resonates with what other people are experiencing, if nothing else just to let them know, that they are not alone with it.

Every good post starts with a quote, right?

> [Industry means] something that is produced or is available in large quantities and makes a lot of money.

We have long referred to our niche of the web as the "web industry" but never has the term been more congruent than it is right now. I believe this throws us into some conflicts, that we are left deal with alone. Because what we've been learned in the decades before, what mattered to the craft of making websites, seems to sometimes not be compatible with what is asked of us from our jobs. This throws us into significant conflict, and resolution seems to be left on our own. In this post I am trying to tackle this conflict that has been on my mind for so long.

## Welcome to the Age of Industrialisation

I think it is very clear for most of us to see, that our little corner of the world has reached the age of industrialisation. With this "little corner", I am referring to the community of people who make websites. Designers, Developers and everything in between and beyond alike.

There are many signs that we have irreversibly entered a new era, one that is determined by industrial practices. We constantly hear, that we're not supposed to _reinvent wheels_, websites are now being derogatorily called MPA's (Multi Page Apps), and we're generally referring to websites as software. UI is now coming in the form of self-contained, composable pieces of single sources of truth's, "components", and the question "will it scale?" is the number one differentiator for "maturity" in tooling surrounding our craft.

### Scalability as Leitdifferenz

A single difference that allows us to sort something into a dichotomy - that is what a "Leitdifferenz" refers to (I am using the German word directly here, to refer to Niklas Luhmann's concept, because I cannot find a semantically fitting translation). We have been obsessed with this difference, that will tell us how well something will adapt with the changing requirements of an organisation and increasing, diverse technical demand. But for businesses, scaling means that output remains or only slightly degrades, while production costs lower.

A course is a scaling product. Because you are investing time into its production and then all you have to do is maybe every now and then generate a promotional advertisement for it, but the price remains the same, while your initial expense disappears entirely. Your margin has increased - your product has scaled. This is the purpose of industry in general. Create a "streamlined" (another term that we have gotten very familiar with) manufacturing process, automate it as much as possible, to generate a product that will sell to as many consumers as possible.

Our industry for the most part is still considered a manufacturing industry, because it still requires manual labour ("manu factum" means "made by hand") at some ends, but these are already also becoming subject to automation.

This is also how we're approaching, and selling, design systems - it is "Design at scale". We can see this reflected in how the dominant design tool, Figma is adjusting their feature set to accommodate processes that are only relevant in very large, distributed design teams: Branching, dedicated organisation plans that include features such as SSO, Design System Analytics (wtf), branching & merging, etc. Even [Brad Frost, the inventor of atomic design, agrees](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-agile-and-industrialization/). In the words of [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/16369):

> [...] design systems take their place in a long history of dehumanising approaches to manufacturing like Taylorism. The priorities of “scientific management” are the same as those of design systems—increasing efficiency and enforcing consistency.

So no. It is not just you. We all feel it. This quote is from 2020, btw. What was then a prediction, has since become reality. And it is also reflected in the way that people are entering the industry. Lately, we've seen a lot of bootcamps popping up, that for the most part educate people _just_ enough so that they can get a job. But they rarely know the basics of the web platform. But they can create a full functioning "web app" with next.js in react! Of course they don't learn how to manage CSS for this type of site, instead they just use tailwind. But at least they know how to specify TypeScript interfaces!

And of course, they learn that design comes from UI Libraries. Gone are the days where we used to tell people that bootstrap is just for prototyping and otherwise will quickly turn into technical dept! Nowadays, designers are sometimes even being told to _start_ with one of these libraries. Just, they're not called bootstrap. Instead, they're called Material UI, Headless UI or Chakra UI. But they bare every necessary resemblance. But it's fine, because it's just the components, right?

What could have become Design Systemics, in which we applied systems theory/theories, cybernetics and constructivism to the process and practice of design, is now instead being reduced to component libraries. As a designer, I find this utter nonsense. Everyone who has even just witnessed a design process happening, knows that the deliverable is merely a documenting artefact of the process, but does not constitute it at all. But for companies, the "output" is all that matters, because it can be measured - it appeals to the industrialised process, because it _scales_. Once a component is designed, it can be reused, configured and composed to produce "free" iterations, without having to consult a designer. Cost was reduced, while the output was maximised. Goal achieved!

## Seats at the Capitalists Table

Design has, in my opinion, degraded massively over the years - not for companies! For the industry, it looks like it was finally embraced as an integral part of the process. But I believe at very, _very_ large costs.

When we referred to ourselves as Web Designers, we were constantly struggling to find companies that took our profession serious enough to integrate us into their processes. But design was not considered valuable. So we started to call ourselves UX Designers, because we were designing experiences, not websites. And slowly but surely, we got our oh so desired seat at the table. But only, if we provided proof of our value, by demonstrating a number-go-up linear-causal relation to our work, requiring, of course, extensive surveillance of our users. And thus, companies have successfully forced us to degrade the merit of our work to quantifiable markers of increased conversions, clicks and the firing of whatever other random KPI that we could somehow pull off our asses - all to appeal to the growth-at-any-cost mindset.

This often happens with important values of our craft. The recent increase of attention on accessibility is already taken a similar path. Accessibility advocates & experts are often forced to "sell" (see what I did there?) accessibility work to companies, by showing them how much more revenue, conversions or users they could be having, by making their sites accessible. But our craft on the other hand clearly dictates this as a primary focus - a Leitdifferenz to judge the merit of our work. If what we do isn't accessible, it's to a certain degree broken, or incomplete at best.

The problem with this angle is that inevitably, industry will answer industriously. And now we're having to explain to companies why they cannot just install an overlay and see it done. But that is the price of putting a number on marginalised groups. Unfortunately that is the language that businesses speak, so experts & advocates are not to blame. They are doing the best that they can, because they know that in the end, the removal of barriers for people who rely on it is what matters. They are in their own way, navigating ambivalence and finding their way through the conflict of craft vs industry.

### When Places become Products

UX Design used to stand for "User Experience", but in order to get our seat at the table, we had to degrade it so much, that it has long since shifted its meaning to "User Exploitation", as [Mark Hurst writes](https://creativegood.com/blog/21/losing-faith-in-ux.html). The practice of UX, removed so far from its subject, that it now considers the company itself the subject of their work, now is being used for bad-faith manipulation to increase capitalist numbers.

This reflected in another marker in language. Were we once web designers, and then UX designers, so are we now calling ourselves "Product Designers". As designers, our relationship to what we design and who we design it for has changed. We used to design websites for people, then experiences for users, now we are designing products for companies.

This coincides with the fact that we are now broadly regarding websites as software - but we're not calling them websites. We're calling them "Apps". And it makes sense - we have entirely normalised the practice of having our websites being controlled by JavaScript from Server to Client, because JavaScript is _mature_ now and thus appealing to traditional programmers, who used to shun it vividly.

This change in demographic of who write code has made it easier to hire for these positions. A website that is entirely rendered in JavaScript can be worked on by someone with a University Degree, in which they rarely learn the special relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript but instead are being told that CSS and HTML are not real programming languages. And with these capital P Programmers come their language and their world view.

## Craftsperson vs Factory worker

Those who work on the web are often required to navigate conflicts between what they've experienced to be the best solution to a problem in their identity as a person who makes websites and what they are expected to do in their identity as a person working in this industry. If it went according to industry, all of our websites should be in react, but alas that is nowhere near the reality. Yet people see themselves forced to work with these technologies, because the only see job postings requiring them to be experienced in it.

This is a conflict between two identities: The craftsperson and the factory worker. The craftsperson wants to do what is dictated by the values of the craft, but the factory worker needs to do what will keep them employed or employable.

### Separating Concerns

Luckily, our platform operates on a philosophical principle that we can apply here as well: Separation of Concerns. If we separate the demand into independent concerns, made by independent parties, we get the chance to instead of having to decide, to hold the ambivalence and the complexity of the situation. Industry of course would force us to reduce complexity, another religious mantra of Programming.

Holding both positions does not change them, but it may allows to not experience them in conflict with each other. If we understand them as a conflict of concerns and not a conflict of identity, we may even see where both concerns even align. Or we can give voices to both parts. At the very least, it may help us to not experience this as a personal conflict, but instead leave it to the job, which has to find a way to utilise craft in a way that makes it compatible enough with industrial processes - another different concern reveals itself here, the concern of the business, not the concern of the employee.

## Failing to conciliate competing Identities

This isn't always possible though. And sometimes, people may decide to leave this industry all together - to protect themselves from this conflict. Not because they couldn't hold it as is, but because they don't want to degrade themselves or their view of the craft.

But if we somehow manage to conciliate those two competing identities, we may find some personal relief from trying to find a common ground between two competing sides within ourselves. I have to work with technology that I find deeply offensive and politically abhorrent all day. But at some point, I found great relief in understanding myself as an employer who works with this tech, not as a craftsperson working not he web. I understand that it is not people who want to create SPA's, it's industry - its businesses.

Many people are not differentiating here, and so they just repeat the capitalist programmers mantras. But that says much more about how they relate to and how they define themselves. Do they even consider themselves as craftspeople? Do they even _see_ the craft that is there? Truly not my problem.

## AI: The Penultimate of Dehumanisation

We do need to talk about AI, because it is an inevitable part of industrialisation and there is no escape for any of us. The desire to reduce manual labour by automation and reduction of complexity is the seed that gave birth to programming in the first place, and AI is a tangible premise of endless scaling. I think it would be incredibly unwise and hubris to assume that the broad majority of us who is employed at this time will remained to be employed in the next years.

Apologists often claim that "we will move on to other things", but that is not true. Some of us will divorce further from craft and appeal to business desires in managing or other administrative jobs but these jobs are given, not earned. The value of our work will inevitably reduce massively, and few of us will be able to do what we do now and get paid for it.

The groundwork for this is laid out already. Take a look at dribbble and you'll find one interchangeable site after another. And this is the dataset that AI is being trained on, because it can't look at actual website, it only looks at pixels for the most part. But even if it were looking at real websites - they have long since started to look so similar, that they are often only differentiated by theming.

In order to protect ourselves from this inevitable reality (again, programming was invented to make human labour in weaving redundant; This is the Leitdifferenz of the entire profession.), we can learn to understand employability does not make us craftspeople.

## The Craft remains

Because the craft will remain even after most of it is automated. You can order mugs online, yet there are still potters out there. We can go into C&A and buy a dress, but there are still seamstresses making bespoke garments. This is the inevitable end destination of the craft - where it started.

Handcrafted websites, made by humans for humans. This is what differentiates our Craftsperson from the Factoryworker - what the Craftsperson does is valuable to people, not businesses.

And until that time comes, we can be both at the same time. We can hold both perspectives as important voices with different concerns. We can switch between them, look for the common ground, or side with one or the other in a given situation.

So the next time you are approaching a website, ask yourself: "What would the Craftsperson do?" And also ask yourself: "What would the Factoryworker do?" - see what answers you come up with!

### Take responsibility: Your Words matter

In this additional section I'd like to jot down some things I believe are important changes for us to make, as a community. I believe it is important for us to adapt our language to adhere to a world in which we can coexists as employees and as craftspeople:

**We should not postulate skills required for jobs as integer to the craft**. This is especially important when it comes to people new to making websites. A person learning to make a website should never be told to learn how to make an SPA at all. In fact, they shouldn't be told to learn JavaScript at all, unless they require it for what they are doing.

But for the goddess' sake, please **do not tell new people to use React, Vue or Svelte**! Just teach them HTML & CSS. All of these tools are valuable and solve real problems, but they are not solving problems for people who are making websites for people. They are solving problems for people who write software for companies.

**We shouldn't tell people who would like to use jQuery to learn webpack or vite** or whatever other bundling tool is the tool of the season. These tools require a world view that is entirely incongruent with how people will think about the web when they start learning about it. Vite for example _requires_ a single index.html file, because it is made for JavaScript rendered SPA's. It is an important ant amazing tool for this use case, but it has no place and no value to someone who just wants to make a website.

***

This is one of the reasons for why I am firmly adhering to my position that bower was never replaced. On their website, they are saying:

> ...psst! While Bower is maintained, we recommend using Yarn and Vite for front-end projects. Read how to migrate!

But yarn and vite are an inappropriate replacement for bower. Bower is used for packages that land directly in the client, because that is what we used to do. Nowadays, as an industry practice, we've accumulated so much JavaScript bullshit that we needed to invent all sorts of esoteric practices to reduce our website weight, so a bundling practice became normality.

But if you just wanna use alpine.js, don't bother with this crap. Luckily we can still use bower, as long as a library is primed for it...

***

**Do not tell people that separation of concerns is outdated**. It is more appropriate than ever. It serves us when we make websites, in so many ways. And it informs the way that the web platform keeps getting improved. It is an important Leitdifferenz for everything web and people should most definitely know about it.

**We should stop referring to ourselves as the web industry**. I believe this has habituated us way too much to its premisses. We are a community of people who make websites, of craftspeople.
